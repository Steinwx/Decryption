# String Decryption Program
The String Decryption Program is a Python script that decrypts an input encrypted string using a predefined decryption dictionary. It provides these features:

Case Insensitivity: Automatically converts input to lowercase for case-insensitive decryption.

Handling Multiple Spaces: Preserves multiple consecutive spaces in the decrypted output.

## How to Use
Run the program and enter an encrypted string.

The program decrypts the string using the decryption dictionary.

The decrypted output is displayed along with character counts (excluding spaces) for both strings.

## Requirements
Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)
## How to Run
Download string_decryption.py.

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the file's directory.

Execute: python string_decryption.py

Follow the instructions to input your encrypted string.

### Examples of Encrypted Strings
Here are some examples of encrypted strings that you can try:

1. *&+!!##*+! -> Decrypted: aouieaio (Character count excluding spaces: 10 -> 7)
2. #***#*+! -> Decrypted: iaaou (Character count excluding spaces: 7 -> 5)
3. !###! -> Decrypted: uui (Character count excluding spaces: 5 -> 3)
